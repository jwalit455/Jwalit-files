<b>Our Vision:</b> To make disciples by leading men and women to saving knowledge
or Our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
<br><br>

<b>Our Strategy:</b> To flow in the Spirit so that we begin to change the 
world around us by allowing others to see Christ in us.
<br><br>

<b>Who we are:</b> New Birth Baptist Church is a beacon of Christian education
to the Community.
<br><br>

<b>Our Motto:</b> "Everybody is Somebody". We are committed to teaching the
Word of God to all ages and all cultures.

<b>Our Worship:</b> Our worship services are vibrant, yet balanced with a 
mixture of the contemporary and traditional elements of worship. We want you 
to be encouraged and built up in your faith as you experience God's
life-changing presence in corporate worship.
